      "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have three examples where the input is a grid of mostly zeros with some 8s, and the output is a transformed grid. The task is to apply the same pattern to the test input.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to look at the examples to see what's happening. Let me start by analyzing each example.\n",
      "\n",
      "**EXAMPLE 1:**\n",
      "Input is a 12x12 grid. There's a small pattern of 8s in the middle. For instance, row 3 (0-indexed?) has an 8 at position 5. Then row 4 has 8s at positions 4, 6. Then row 5 has an 8 at position 5. The output is a more complex grid with 8s arranged in a sort of wave-like pattern or maybe a specific shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the output in example 1 has 8s forming a sort of rectangle or maybe a diamond? Hmm. Let me look more carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the input for example 1 has 8s in rows 3-5 (assuming 0-based index). Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 3 (4th row): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
      "Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
      "Row 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
      "\n",
      "So the input has a vertical line of 8s with a horizontal line in the middle. The output seems to generate a larger structure with 8s forming a sort of \"frame\" or \"border\" around some area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the pattern is that the output is a transformation where the input's 8s are used to create a \"wave\" or \"expanding\" pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton step where the 8s propagate in certain directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the output is a \"reflection\" or \"rotation\" of the input pattern. Let me check the outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In example 1's output, the first row starts with [0,8,0,8,8,8,...], so there's a pattern of 8s starting from the left. Hmm. Maybe the pattern is that the input's 8s are the \"seeds\" for a larger pattern that's generated by some rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach: look for the position of the 8s in the input and see how they map to the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "In example 1's input, the 8s are at positions (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5). So a small cross shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The output seems to have a more complex structure. Let's see the first few rows of the output:\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 0: [0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n",
      "Row 1: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n",
      "Row 2: [0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 3: [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 4: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 5: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 6: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 8: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 10: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8]\n",
      "Row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, this output looks like a sort of \"wave\" propagating from the center. Maybe the input's 8s are the starting points for some kind of wave that spreads out in a specific way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the output is a \"filled\" version of the input's pattern. Let's see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another angle: the examples have the input grids with some 8s arranged in a specific way, and the output grids have 8s arranged in a pattern that's a \"mirror\" or \"symmetric\" version. For example, the output might be a reflection over the vertical axis or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at example 3's input and output. Let's check that.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXAMPLE 3:\n",
      "Input is a 16x16 grid. The 8s are in rows 5,6,7,8,9 (0-based?), with some positions. For instance, row 5 has an 8 at column 6, row 6 same column, row 7 has 8s at columns 4,5,7,8, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The output of example 3 starts with [8,0,0,0,...], then rows with 8s in a pattern. It seems like the output is a more complex structure that's built around the input's 8s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the pattern is that the output is a \"Sierpinski triangle\" or some fractal pattern, but the examples don't seem to follow that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's 8s and then creating a \"border\" around them, expanding outward in each step. But how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another idea: The input grids have a single \"object\" (the 8s) and the output is a \"frame\" or \"contour\" of that object. But in the examples, the input's 8s are sparse, and the output has many 8s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the transformation is that the input's 8s are the \"edges\" of a shape, and the output is the \"interior\" filled with 8s. But that might not fit.\n",
      "\n",

198, 151644, 77091, 198, 151667, 198], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text='First, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples. Then I\\'ll apply it to the test input.\\n\\nLooking at the examples:\\n\\n**EXAMPLE 1:**\\nInput: [[2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2]]\\nOutput: A 9x9 grid. It seems like the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 3 times 3 times 3? 3 rows, each with 9 elements. 3*3=9 columns.\\n\\nThe output has 9 rows and 9 columns. Let me see how it\\'s constructed.\\n\\nOutput rows:\\n- Row 0: [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2] → This looks like the input row 0 repeated 3 times.\\nInput row 0: [2, 0, 2] → repeated 3 times: [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2] → yes, matches.\\n\\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0] → Input row 1: [0,2,0] repeated 3 times.\\n\\n- Row 2: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] → Input row 2: [2,2,2] repeated 3 times.\\n\\nBut then it has more rows: row 3 to 8 are the same as row 0 to 2? Row 3: [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2] same as row 0.\\n\\nRow 4: same as row 1.\\n\\nRow 5: same as row 2.\\n\\nRow 6: same as row 0.\\n\\nRow 7: same as row 1.\\n\\nRow 8: same as row 2.\\n\\nSo it\\'s like the input grid is repeated 3 times horizontally and vertically? Let\\'s see the dimensions.\\n\\nInput is 3x3. Output is 9x9. 9 = 3 * 3, so it\\'s the input grid repeated 3 times in both directions.\\n\\nBut in terms of the output, it\\'s a block of the input repeated 3 times row-wise and 3 times column-wise? Not exactly.\\n\\nFor a 3x3 input, output has 3 rows of the input row repeated 3 times, and then another 3 rows of the same, and another 3 rows.\\n\\nIn this case, output has 3 sets of rows: each set has the input rows repeated horizontally.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n\\n- First 3 rows: each row is input row i repeated 3 times (for i=0,1,2)\\n\\n- Next 3 rows: same as first 3 rows? Row 3 is same as row 0, row 4 same as row 1, row 5 same as row 2.\\n\\n- Last 3 rows: row 6 same as row 0, row 7 same as row 1, row 8 same as row 2.\\n\\nSo it\\'s like the output is a 3x3 grid of the input grid? Meaning, each element of the output is a copy of the input grid.\\n\\nIn matrix terms, if input is A (3x3), output is A repeated 3 times in row direction and 3 times in column direction, but since it\\'s a grid, it\\'s a Kronecker product with a 3x3 all-ones matrix or something? Let\\'s think.\\n\\nKronecker product of A with a 3x3 matrix of ones would give a 9x9 matrix where each element is A[i,j] repeated 3 times in row and column? I\\'m getting confused.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s simpler: the output has the same number of rows as the input multiplied by 3, and each row is the input row repeated 3 times.\\n\\nIn this case, input has 3 rows, output has 9 rows. Each output row has 9 elements, which is 3 times the input row length (3).\\n\\nBut in the output, the rows are grouped: rows 0-2 are the input rows repeated horizontally, rows 3-5 are the same as rows 0-2, rows 6-8 are the same as rows 0-2.\\n\\nIn example 1, row 3 is identical to row 0, so it\\'s not that each block is shifted; it\\'s the same pattern repeated.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at example 2.\\n\\n**EXAMPLE 2:**\\nInput: [[1, 0], [1, 1]]  → 2x2 grid\\nOutput: [[1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]\\n\\nOutput is 4x4. Input is 2x2, so 2*2=4.\\n\\n- Row 0: [1,0,1,0] → input row 0 repeated twice? Input row 0: [1,0], repeated twice: [1,0,1,0] yes.\\n\\n- Row 1: [1,1,1,1] → input row 1: [1,1] repeated twice: [1,1,1,1] yes.\\n\\n- Row 2: [1,0,1,0] → same as row 0\\n\\n- Row 3: [1,1,1,1] → same as row 1\\n\\nSo output has 2 sets of rows: first 2 rows are input rows repeated horizontally, next 2 rows are identical to first 2 rows.\\n\\nSimilarly, in example 1, it had 3 sets of rows.\\n\\n**EXAMPLE 3:**\\nInput: [[0, 3], [3, 0]] → 2x2\\nOutput: [[0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 3, 0]]\\n\\n- Row 0: [0,3,0,3] → input row 0 [0,3] repeated twice\\n\\n- Row 1: [3,0,3,0] → input row 1 [3,0] repeated twice\\n\\n- Row 2: same as row 0\\n\\n- Row 3: same as row 1\\n\\nAgain, 2 sets of rows.\\n\\n**EXAMPLE 4:**\\nInput: [[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0]] → 3x3\\nOutput: 9x9 grid\\n\\n- Row 0: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8] → input row 0 [0,0,8] repeated 3 times\\n\\n- Row 1: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] → input row 1 [8,8,8] repeated 3 times\\n\\n- Row 2: [8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] → input row 2 [8,0,0] repeated 3 times? [8,0,0] repeated 3 times is [8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] yes.\\n\\nThen row 3: same as row 0\\n\\nRow 4: same as row 1\\n\\nRow 5: same as row 2\\n\\nRow 6: same as row 0\\n\\nRow 7: same as row 1\\n\\nRow 8: same as row 2\\n\\nSo pattern: for an input grid of size m x n, the output is a grid of size (m * k) x (n * k) where k is... in examples, for m=3, n=3, k=3; for m=2, n=2, k=2.\\n\\nIn example 2, m=2, n=2, output size 4x4, so k=2.\\n\\nIn example 3, same.\\n\\nIn example 5, input is 4x4, output is 16x16? Let\\'s check.\\n\\n**EXAMPLE 5:**\\nInput: [[0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0]] → 4x4\\nOutput: 16 rows? Output has 16 rows, each with 16 elements? Let\\'s see the output description.\\n\\nIt says: Output: [[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], ... and it lists 16 rows? The text shows multiple lines, but it says \"Output: [[...], [...], ...]\" with 16 entries? Counting the rows.\\n\\nIn the text: it starts with [0,0,2,0,...] and goes to [2,2,2,0,...] and there are 16 rows listed? Let me count the lines in the output description.\\n\\nIt says: \"Output: [[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], ... up to 16 rows?]\\n\\nIt lists 16 rows: from the text, it shows 4 rows and then says \"and so on\" but in the code block, it has multiple lines. To save time, I can see that the output has 16 rows (since 4*4=16) and each row has 16 elements (4*4).\\n\\nIn the output, row 0: [0,0,2,0] repeated 4 times? Input row 0: [0,0,2,0], repeated 4 times: [0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0] — yes, that\\'s 16 elements.\\n\\nSimilarly, row 1: input row 1 [2,0,2,0] repeated 4 times: [2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0] — matches.\\n\\nRow 2: input row 2 [0,2,0,2] repeated 4 times.\\n\\nRow 3: input row 3 [2,2,2,0] repeated 4 times.\\n\\nThen row 4: same as row 0\\n\\nRow 5: same as row 1\\n\\nAnd so on, up to row 15.\\n\\nSo output has 4 * 4 = 16 rows, each row is input row repeated 4 times (since n=4 columns).\\n\\nThe repetition factor k seems to be equal to the number of rows in input, m.\\n\\nIn example 1: m=3, k=3\\n\\nExample 2: m=2, k=2\\n\\nExample 3: m=2, k=2\\n\\nExample 4: m=3, k=3\\n\\nExample 5: m=4, k=4\\n\\nNow, example 6:\\n\\n**EXAMPLE 6:**\\nInput: [[0, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7]] → 4x4\\nOutput: 16x16 grid\\n\\n- Row 0: [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0] → input row 0 [0,7,0,0] repeated 4 times? [0,7,0,0] repeated 4 times: [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0] yes.\\n\\n- Row 1: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7] → input row 1 [7,7,7,7] repeated 4 times.\\n\\n- Row 2: [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0] same as row 0\\n\\n- Row 3: [0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7] → input row 3 [0,7,0,7] repeated 4 times: [0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7] yes.\\n\\nThen row 4: same as row 0\\n\\nRow 5: same as row 1\\n\\nRow 6: same as row 2\\n\\nRow 7: same as row 3\\n\\nAnd so on for 16 rows.\\n\\nSo the pattern is: for an input grid of size m x n, the output is a grid of size (m * m) x (n * m)? Let\\'s see the dimensions.\\n\\nIn all cases, output rows: m * m? In example 1, m=3, output rows=9=3*3\\n\\nExample 2, m=2, output rows=4=2*2\\n\\nExample 3, m=2, output rows=4=2*2\\n\\nExample 4, m=3, output rows=9=3*3\\n\\nExample 5, m=4, output rows=16=4*4\\n\\nExample 6, m=4, output rows=16=4*4\\n\\nOutput columns: in example 1, n=3, output columns=9=3*3\\n\\nBut 3 is m, so columns = n * m? n=3, m=3, 3*3=9.\\n\\nIn example 2, n=2, m=2, columns=4=2*2\\n\\nExample 3, n=2, m=2, columns=4\\n\\nExample 4, n=3, m=3, columns=9\\n\\nExample 5, n=4, m=4, columns=16\\n\\nExample 6, n=4, m=4, columns=16\\n\\nSo output size is (m * m) rows by (n * m) columns? m * m rows, and n * m columns.\\n\\nSince m = n in all these examples? In example 1, m=3, n=3; example 2, m=2, n=2; all the inputs are square matrices? Let me check.\\n\\nIn the inputs:\\n\\nExample 1: 3x3\\n\\nExample 2: 2x2\\n\\nExample 3: 2x2\\n\\nExample 4: 3x3\\n\\nExample 5: 4x4\\n\\nExample 6: 4x4\\n\\nAll are square matrices. The test input is also square: [[0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8]] → that\\'s 5 rows and 5 columns, so 5x5.\\n\\nIn the pattern, for an m x m input, output is (m * m) x (m * m) grid.\\n\\nAnd each row in output is the corresponding input row repeated m times horizontally.\\n\\nThen, the output has m blocks of rows, each block being the input rows repeated horizontally.\\n\\nSpecifically, output row i (for i from 0 to m*m - 1) is constructed as:\\n\\nLet k = m (the size)\\n\\nFor row index j from 0 to m-1, the output rows for the first block (j=0 to m-1) are the input row j repeated k times.\\n\\nThen the next block (j=m to 2m-1) is the same as the first block, so row m + i has the same as row i for i=0 to m-1.\\n\\nIn terms of the output rows:\\n\\nOutput has m * m rows.\\n\\nFor each output row index r (0-based), it corresponds to input row index i = r // m\\n\\nThen the row is input row i repeated m times.\\n\\nIn example 1: m=3\\n\\nr=0: i=0//3=0, input row 0 repeated 3 times\\n\\nr=1: i=1//3=0? 1//3=0 in integer division, yes.\\n\\nr=2: i=2//3=0\\n\\nr=3: i=3//3=1\\n\\nr=4: i=4//3=1\\n\\nr=5: i=5//3=1\\n\\nr=6: i=6//3=2\\n\\nr=7: i=7//3=2\\n\\nr=8: i=8//3=2\\n\\nYes, that matches.\\n\\nIn example 2: m=2\\n\\nr=0: i=0//2=0\\n\\nr=1: i=1//2=0? 1//2=0 in integer division? In Python, 1//2=0, but let\\'s see.\\n\\nOutput rows: row 0: i=0, input row 0\\n\\nRow 1: i=1//2=0? But in output, row 1 is input row 1.\\n\\nProblem.\\n\\nIn example 2: input rows: row0: [1,0], row1: [1,1]\\n\\nOutput row 0: [1,0,1,0] → input row 0 repeated\\n\\nOutput row 1: [1,1,1,1] → input row 1 repeated\\n\\nOutput row 2: [1,0,1,0] → same as row 0\\n\\nOutput row 3: [1,1,1,1] → same as row 1\\n\\nSo for r=0: i = r // m = 0 // 2 = 0\\n\\nr=1: i = 1 // 2 = 0? But we want i=1 for row 1.\\n\\nIn integer division, 1 // 2 = 0, but we need the row index to be 1 for the second row.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s better to think in terms of blocks.\\n\\nThe output has m blocks of rows, each block containing m rows that are identical to the input rows.\\n\\nFor block b (0 to m-1), the rows in that block are: for each i in 0 to m-1, row (b * m + i) is input row i repeated m times.\\n\\nIn example 2: m=2\\n\\nBlock 0: rows 0 and 1\\n\\n- Row 0: input row 0 repeated\\n\\n- Row 1: input row 1 repeated\\n\\nBlock 1: rows 2 and 3\\n\\n- Row 2: input row 0 repeated (same as row 0)\\n\\n- Row 3: input row 1 repeated (same as row 1)\\n\\nIn the output, row 2 is same as row 0, which is input row 0.\\n\\nSimilarly in example 1: m=3\\n\\nBlock 0: rows 0,1,2 → each is input row repeated 3 times\\n\\nBlock 1: rows 3,4,5 → same as block 0\\n\\nBlock 2: rows 6,7,8 → same as block 0\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the pattern is: for an m x m input matrix, the output is a (m * m) x (m * m) matrix where:\\n\\n- The output has m blocks of m rows each.\\n\\n- Each block b (0 <= b < m) consists of m rows, each row being the input row i repeated m times, for i from 0 to m-1.\\n\\nIn each block, the rows are in order: row i for i=0 to m-1.\\n\\nIn the output, for a given block b, the rows are: for i=0 to m-1, the row is input_row[i] repeated m times.\\n\\nAnd this is repeated for b=0 to m-1.\\n\\nIn the row index: output row (b * m + i) is input_row[i] repeated m times.\\n\\nFor the test input, I need to apply this.\\n\\nFirst, what is the input for test?\\n\\nTest Input: [[0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8]]\\n\\nThis is a 5x5 matrix. So m = 5.\\n\\nOutput should be (5 * 5) = 25 rows, each with 25 elements.\\n\\nFor each output row index r from 0 to 24:\\n\\nLet b = r // 5  (block index)\\n\\ni = r % 5  (row index within block)\\n\\nThen output row r = input_row[i] repeated 5 times.\\n\\nIn the output, for a fixed b, the rows are input row 0, input row 1, ..., input row 4, each repeated 5 times.\\n\\nAnd this is done for b=0 to 4.\\n\\nIn the pattern, from examples, it seems that for each block, it\\'s the same set of rows: input row 0, row 1, etc.\\n\\nIn example 2, block 0: row0 and row1 (input row0 and row1)\\n\\nBlock 1: row2 and row3 (same as row0 and row1)\\n\\nSimilarly in all.\\n\\nSo for test input:\\n\\nm = 5\\n\\nInput rows:\\n\\nRow 0: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\\n\\nRow 1: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\\n\\nRow 2: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\\n\\nRow 3: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\\n\\nRow 4: [0, 8, 8, 0, 8]\\n\\nNow, output will have 25 rows.\\n\\nFor each block b from 0 to 4:\\n\\n- For i from 0 to 4:\\n\\n  - Output row (b * 5 + i) = input_row[i] repeated 5 times.\\n\\nIn the output, the rows should be:\\n\\nFirst block (b=0):\\n\\n- Row 0: [0,8,8,0,0] repeated 5 times → [0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]? Let\\'s write it properly.\\n\\nInput row i has 5 elements, repeated 5 times: so 25 elements.\\n\\n[0,8,8,0,0] repeated 5 times: [0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0]? But in the repetition, it\\'s the sequence repeated, so it should be: for each element in the row, repeated 5 times? No.\\n\\nWhen we say \"repeated 5 times\", for a row of length n, repeated k times means the sequence is concatenated k times.\\n\\nSo for input row [a,b,c,d,e], repeated 5 times: [a,b,c,d,e, a,b,c,d,e, a,b,c,d,e, a,b,c,d,e, a,b,c,d,e]\\n\\nSo for row 0: [0,8,8,0,0] → repeated 5 times: [0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0]\\n\\nBut in the list, it\\'s a flat list.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nIn the output, it should be a list of lists.\\n\\nNow, for the test output, I need to generate this.\\n\\nBut let\\'s confirm with the examples to make sure.\\n\\nIn example 5, input row 0: [0,0,2,0] repeated 4 times: [0,0,2,0, 0,0,2,0, 0,0,2,0, 0,0,2,0] which matches the output row 0.\\n\\nSimilarly.\\n\\nSo for test input, m=5.\\n\\nOutput rows:\\n\\nFor b=0:\\n\\n- r=0: i=0, output row = input row 0 repeated 5 times: [0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0, 0,8,8,0,0]? Let\\'s write as a list.\\n\\nThe list: positions: 0:0, 1:8, 2:8, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:8, 7:8, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:8, 12:8, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0, 16:8, 17:8, 18:0, 19:0, 20:0, 21:8, 22:8, 23:0, 24:0\\n\\nIn the repetition, it\\'s the same as the row sequence, so for each repetition, it\\'s [0,8,8,0,0], so the list has 25 elements.\\n\\nSimilarly, r=1: i=1, output row = input row 1 repeated 5 times: [8,8,8,8,8] repeated 5 times → [8,8,8,8,8, 8,8,8,8,8, 8,8,8,8,8, 8,8,8,8,8, 8,8,8,8,8]\\n\\nr=2: i=2, input row 2: [0,8,8,0,0] repeated 5 times → same as row 0\\n\\nr=3: i=3, input row 3: [8,8,8,8,8] repeated 5 times → same as row 1\\n\\nr=4: i=4, input row 4: [0,8,8,0,8] repeated 5 times → [0,8,8,0,8, 0,8,8,0,8, 0,8,8,0,8, 0,8,8,0,8, 0,8,8,0,8]\\n\\nNow, for b=1:\\n\\nr=5: i=0, output row = input row 0 repeated 5 times (same as r=0)\\n\\nr=6: i=1, same as r=1\\n\\nr=7: i=2, same as r=2\\n\\nr=8: i=3, same as r=3\\n\\nr=9: i=4, same as r=4\\n\\nSimilarly for b=2,3,4.\\n\\nIn the output, all rows are repeated, so the first 5 rows are the same as the next 5 rows, etc.\\n\\nSpecifically, output rows 0 to 4: as above\\n\\nRows 5 to 9: same as rows 0 to 4\\n\\nRows 10 to 14: same as rows 0 to 4\\n\\nRows 15 to 19: same as rows 0 to 4\\n\\nRows 20 to 24: same as rows 0 to 4\\n\\nIn the pattern, since b from 0 to 4, each block has rows i=0 to 4.\\n\\nIn the output list, it should be a list of 25 lists, each with 25 integers.\\n\\nNow, to write it out.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s define the input rows:\\n\\ninput = [\\n  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0],  # row0\\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8],  # row1\\n  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0],  # row2\\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8],  # row3\\n  [0, 8, 8, 0, 8]   # row4\\n]\\n\\nFor each row in output, it\\'s a repetition of input[i] 5 times.\\n\\nIn code terms, for a given i, the row is [element for _ in range(5) for element in input[i]] but better to do: input[i] * 5, but in Python list, it\\'s not directly, but for the output, we can generate the list.\\n\\nSince we need to output as JSON list of lists.\\n\\nThe output should be:\\n\\n[\\n\\n  # block 0\\n\\n  [0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0],  # row0\\n\\n  [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],  # row1\\n\\n

All the inputs are lists of lists, each inner list has 9 elements. There are 11 such lists in each input. The outputs are lists of lists with 4 elements each, and there are 5 such lists.\\n\\nLet me look at the examples to see what\\'s happening.\\n\\nStarting with EXAMPLE 1:\\n\\nInput: [[7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0],\\n [7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 9, 9, 0, 9],\\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 9, 0],\\n [0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n [7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0],\\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\\n [2, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n [2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8],\\n [2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 8, 0, 0, 8],\\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0],\\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8]]\\n\\nOutput: [[7, 0, 9, 0],\\n [7, 7, 8, 8],\\n [8, 9, 9, 8],\\n [0, 8, 7, 2],\\n [7, 0, 8, 8]]\\n\\nI notice that in the input, there\\'s a row with all 4s: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. That seems like a separator. Also, the numbers are 0,2,4,7,8,9. 4 is special.\\n\\nIn the output, it\\'s a 5x4 grid.\\n\\nLet me see if the output is derived from specific parts of the input.\\n\\nAnother thing: in all inputs, the 6th row (index 5) is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], so it\\'s the middle row.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the output, it\\'s 5 rows of 4 elements each.\\n\\nI should split the input into two parts: the top part and the bottom part.\\n\\nLet\\'s index the rows from 0 to 10.\\n\\nRow 5 is the all-4s row.\\n\\nSo rows 0-4 are the \"top\" section, and rows 6-10 are the \"bottom\" section? But row 5 is the separator.\\n\\nIn the input, rows 0 to 4: that\\'s 5 rows, and rows 6 to 10: that\\'s 5 rows, with row 5 being the separator.\\n\\nIn EXAMPLE 1, input has 11 rows: indices 0 to 10.\\n\\nRow 5 (index 5) is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4].\\n\\nSo top: rows 0-4 (5 rows), bottom: rows 6-10 (5 rows).\\n\\nNow, each row has 9 elements.\\n\\nThe output is 5x4.\\n\\nI need to see how the output is generated from top and bottom.\\n\\nLet me look at the values.\\n\\nIn the top section (rows 0-4), there are numbers like 7,0,9,4 but 4 is the separator, so probably the non-4 values are important.\\n\\nSimilarly in bottom section.\\n\\nIn the output, for EXAMPLE 1, output is [[7, 0, 9, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 9, 9, 8], [0, 8, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 8]]\\n\\nNow, let\\'s see what corresponds.\\n\\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero values or something, but there are zeros.\\n\\nAnother idea: maybe the pattern is related to the positions where there are non-4 values, and we\\'re extracting a 4x4 grid or something.\\n\\nLet\\'s list the top section for EXAMPLE 1:\\n\\nRow 0: [7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]\\n\\nRow 1: [7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 9, 9, 0, 9]\\n\\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 9, 0]\\n\\nRow 3: [0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nRow 4: [7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nBottom section:\\n\\nRow 6: [2, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nRow 7: [2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8]\\n\\nRow 8: [2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 8, 0, 0, 8]\\n\\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0]\\n\\nRow 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8]\\n\\nNow, output: [[7, 0, 9, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 9, 9, 8], [0, 8, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 8]]\\n\\nI see that in the output, the first row has 7,0,9,0. Where do these come from?\\n\\nIn top row 0, we have 7 and 9, but with zeros.\\n\\nSimilarly, bottom row 7 has 8,8.\\n\\nLet\\'s think of the columns.\\n\\nThe input has 9 columns. The 5th element is always 4 (index 4, since 0-based), so columns 0-3 and 5-8 are the data, with column 4 being 4.\\n\\nIn each row, position 4 is 4, so the row is split into left (cols 0-3) and right (cols 5-8).\\n\\nFor top section, rows 0-4:\\n\\nFor each row, left: cols 0-3, right: cols 5-8\\n\\nSimilarly for bottom.\\n\\nIn output, it\\'s 4 elements per row, so probably we\\'re taking something from left and right.\\n\\nLet\\'s compare output to input.\\n\\nFor output row 0: [7, 0, 9, 0]\\n\\nIn top row 0: left: [7,0,0,0], right: [0,0,9,0]  (cols 5-8: index 5,6,7,8)\\n\\nCol 5 is index 5, which is the first of right.\\n\\nIn row 0, right: indices 5,6,7,8: values 0,0,9,0\\n\\nBut output has 7,0,9,0 — so 7 from left, 0 from left? left is [7,0,0,0], so first is 7, second is 0, but output has 7,0,9,0 — so 9 from right.\\n\\nNot matching directly.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s not per row.\\n\\nAnother idea: the output might be formed by taking the \"boundary\" values or the non-zero values in a specific order.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the examples to find a common pattern.\\n\\nI am considering that the 4 in the middle is a separator, and the numbers 7,9 are from the top, 2,8 from the bottom.\\n\\nIn the output, we have combinations.\\n\\nLet\\'s take EXAMPLE 1 output: [7,0,9,0] for row 0.\\n\\nIn the input, for the top part, the 9s are in the right section.\\n\\nSimilarly, 7s in left.\\n\\nBut output has 0s too.\\n\\nPerhaps for each output row, it\\'s derived from the corresponding top and bottom rows.\\n\\nLet\\'s list the output rows and see which input rows they correspond to.\\n\\nOutput row 0: [7,0,9,0]\\n\\nOutput row 1: [7,7,8,8]\\n\\nOutput row 2: [8,9,9,8]\\n\\nOutput row 3: [0,8,7,2]\\n\\nOutput row 4: [7,0,8,8]\\n\\nNow, for output row 0, it has a 7 and 9, which are from top, and 0s.\\n\\nIn top section, row 0 has 7 and 9.\\n\\nIn bottom section, row 6 has 2 and 0, but output row 0 has 0, not 2.\\n\\nOutput row 3 has 2, which is from bottom.\\n\\nLet\\'s see the last element of output row 3: 2, and in bottom, row 6 has 2.\\n\\nBut output row 3 is [0,8,7,2], so 2 is the last element.\\n\\nSimilarly, in output row 4: [7,0,8,8], 8 is from bottom.\\n\\nI am considering that the output is a combination of the top and bottom sections for specific columns.\\n\\nAnother thought: in all examples, the output has 4 elements, and the input has 9 columns, with column 4 being 4. So columns 0-3 and 5-8 are used, each with 4 columns.\\n\\nThe output might be a 4x4 grid where each row is from a specific position.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the values.\\n\\nI recall that in some puzzles, it\\'s about finding the most common or something, but let\\'s see.\\n\\nPerhaps the pattern is to take the non-zero values from the top and bottom in a certain order.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all non-zero values for top section in EXAMPLE 1.\\n\\nTop section (rows 0-4):\\n\\nRow 0: 7,9\\n\\nRow 1: 7,7,9,9,9\\n\\nRow 2: 9,9\\n\\nRow 3: 7\\n\\nRow 4: 7,7,9\\n\\nSo non-zeros: 7,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,9\\n\\nBut output has specific order.\\n\\nSimilarly bottom section:\\n\\nRow 6: 2,2\\n\\nRow 7: 2,2,8,8\\n\\nRow 8: 2,2,8,8\\n\\nRow 9: 2,8\\n\\nRow 10: 8,8\\n\\nNon-zeros: 2,2,2,2,8,8,2,2,8,8,2,8,8,8\\n\\nOutput has 7,0,9,0 etc.\\n\\n0 is present, so it\\'s not just non-zeros.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the \"frame\" or the corners of the non-zero regions.\\n\\nLet\\'s visualize the top section.\\n\\nFor top section, the non-zero values form some shapes.\\n\\nIn row 0: col 0:7, col 7:9\\n\\nRow 1: col 0:7, col1:7, col5:9, col6:9, col8:9\\n\\nRow 2: col6:9, col7:9\\n\\nRow 3: col2:7\\n\\nRow 4: col0:7, col2:7, col3:7, col5:9\\n\\nSo it\\'s like a 7 and 9 pattern.\\n\\nSimilarly for bottom.\\n\\nBut output is small.\\n\\nPerhaps for each output row, it corresponds to a pair of rows from top and bottom.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the output for EXAMPLE 1: first output row [7,0,9,0]\\n\\nIn the input, for the top, the first row has 7 at col0 and 9 at col7.\\n\\nCol7 is the 8th column? Let\\'s index columns.\\n\\nColumns: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\n\\nSo col4 is 4.\\n\\nFor a row, left part: cols 0,1,2,3\\n\\nRight part: cols 5,6,7,8\\n\\nIn output row 0: [7,0,9,0]\\n\\n7 could be from top row 0 col0\\n\\n0 could be from top row 0 col1 or something\\n\\n9 from top row 0 col7? col7 is index 7, which is in right part.\\n\\nIn right part, col5,6,7,8: for row 0, values [0,0,9,0] so col7 is 9 (since index 7)\\n\\nSimilarly, 0 could be from left part col1 or right part.\\n\\nBut output has 0 as second element.\\n\\nLet\\'s see if there\\'s a pattern in the columns used.\\n\\nI am considering that the output is generated by taking for each of the 5 rows, the value from the top row at a certain position and bottom row at a certain position.\\n\\nBut output has 4 values per row, so two positions from top and two from bottom? But the values are mixed.\\n\\nIn output row 0: [7,0,9,0] — 7 and 9 are from top, 0s are from where?\\n\\nIn top section, all rows have zeros.\\n\\nPerhaps the 0s are placeholders.\\n\\nAnother approach: let\\'s look at the difference between input and output.\\n\\nI notice that in the output, for EXAMPLE 1, the last two columns of output seem related to the bottom section.\\n\\nOutput row 1: [7,7,8,8] — 8,8 from bottom row 7 or 8.\\n\\nBottom row 7: [2,0,0,2,4,0,0,8,8] so right part: [0,0,8,8] for cols 5-8? cols 5,6,7,8: index 5:0,6:0,7:8,8:8 so [0,0,8,8]\\n\\nBut output row 1 has 8,8, not 0,0.\\n\\nOutput row 1 has 7,7,8,8 — 7,7 from top, 8,8 from bottom.\\n\\nTop row 1: left part cols 0-3: [7,7,0,0] so 7,7 at col0 and col1.\\n\\nBottom row 7: right part cols 5-8: [0,0,8,8] but output has 8,8, so it\\'s the last two of right part.\\n\\nSimilarly, for output row 0: [7,0,9,0]\\n\\nTop row 0: left: [7,0,0,0] so first is 7, second is 0\\n\\nRight: [0,0,9,0] so third is 9, fourth is 0\\n\\nOutput: [7,0,9,0] — so it matches the left part and right part for the same row? Left part has 4 elements, right part has 4 elements, but output has 4 elements, so for each row, output row i is [top_row_i_left[0], top_row_i_left[1], top_row_i_right[2], top_row_i_right[3]] or something? Let\\'s see.\\n\\nFor row 0:\\n\\ntop_row_0_left: indices 0,1,2,3: [7,0,0,0]\\n\\ntop_row_0_right: indices 5,6,7,8: [0,0,9,0]\\n\\nIf output row 0 is [top_row_0_left[0], top_row_0_left[1], top_row_0_right[2], top_row_0_right[3]]? top_row_0_left[0] =7, top_row_0_left[1]=0, top_row_0_right[2]=9 (since index 5:0,6:0,7:9,8:0 so right[0]=0, right[1]=0, right[2]=9, right[3]=0), so [7,0,9,0] — yes! That matches output row 0: [7,0,9,0]\\n\\nGreat!\\n\\nNow check for row 1.\\n\\nTop row 1: [7,7,0,0,4,9,9,0,9] so left: [7,7,0,0], right: [9,9,0,9] (cols 5,6,7,8)\\n\\nOutput row 1: [7,7,8,8]\\n\\nBut 8,8 is from bottom, not top.\\n\\nIn my previous, I thought it was from top, but output has 8,8 which is from bottom.\\n\\nMistake.\\n\\nOutput row 1 is [7,7,8,8], so 7,7 from top, but 8,8 from bottom.\\n\\nSimilarly, for row 0, output has 9,0 from top right, but 9 and 0 are top values.\\n\\nIn row 0, output has 9 and 0 from top, no bottom.\\n\\nIn row 1, output has 8 and 8 from bottom.\\n\\nInconsistent.\\n\\nLet\\'s list for each output row which sections it comes from.\\n\\nFor EXAMPLE 1:\\n\\nOutput row 0: [7,0,9,0] — all from top? Top row 0: left has 7,0; right has 9,0? But right has [0,0,9,0], so positions: if we take left[0], left[1], right[2], right[3] = 7,0,9,0 — yes.\\n\\nOutput row 1: [7,7,8,8] — 7,7 from top row 1 left[0], left[1]? Top row 1 left: [7,7,0,0] so left[0]=7, left[1]=7, but 8,8 from bottom.\\n\\nBottom row 7: [2,0,0,2,4,0,0,8,8] so right: [0,0,8,8] so right[2]=8, right[3]=8? right[0]=0 (col5), right[1]=0 (col6), right[2]=8 (col7), right[3]=8 (col8)\\n\\nSo for output row 1, it has top row 1 left[0], top row 1 left[1], bottom row 7 right[2], bottom row 7 right[3] = 7,7,8,8 — yes!\\n\\nNow output row 2: [8,9,9,8]\\n\\n8 from bottom? Bottom row 8: [2,0,0,2,4,8,0,0,8] so right: [8,0,0,8] (cols 5,6,7,8: 8,0,0,8)\\n\\n9 from top? Top row 2: [0,0,0,0,4,0,9,9,0] left: [0,0,0,0], right: [0,9,9,0] so right[1]=9, right[2]=9\\n\\nOutput row 2: [8,9,9,8] — so 8,9,9,8\\n\\n8 could be from bottom row 8 right[0] =8? right[0] is col5=8\\n\\n9 from top row 2 right[1] and right[2]\\n\\nBut output has 9,9, so two 9s.\\n\\nLet\\'s see the pattern.\\n\\nFor output row 2, it might be from different rows.\\n\\nIn general, for output row i, it uses:\\n\\n- First element: from top row i, left[0] or something\\n\\n- Second element: from top row i, left[1] or bottom\\n\\nI need to find a consistent mapping.\\n\\nFrom the output row 0: [7,0,9,0] = top row 0 left[0], top row 0 left[1], top row 0 right[2], top row 0 right[3]\\n\\nFor output row 1: [7,7,8,8] = top row 1 left[0], top row 1 left[1], bottom row 7 right[2], bottom row 7 right[3]\\n\\nBottom row 7 is row 7, which is the first bottom row? Rows 6-10 are bottom, row 6 is index 6, row 7 is index 7.\\n\\nIn output row 1, it used bottom row 7.\\n\\nSimilarly, for output row 2: [8,9,9,8]\\n\\n8: from bottom row 8? Bottom row 8: [2,0,0,2,4,8,0,0,8] so right[0] =8 (col5)\\n\\n9: from top row 2? Top row 2: right[1] =9 (col6), right[2]=9 (col7)\\n\\n8: from bottom row 8 right[3] =8 (col8)\\n\\nSo output row 2: [bottom row 8 right[0], top row 2 right[1], top row 2 right[2], bottom row 8 right[3]]? But output has [8,9,9,8], so positions: 8, then 9,9, then 8.\\n\\nSo it\\'s not consistent per row.\\n\\nPerhaps the output rows correspond to different row indices.\\n\\nLet\\'s list the output rows and the input rows used.\\n\\nFor EXAMPLE 1:\\n\\nOutput row 0: uses top row 0, and for the last two, it used top row 0 right, but in this case, it was top.\\n\\nIn output row 0, all from top row 0.\\n\\nOutput row 1: top row 1 left[0], top row 1 left[1], bottom row 7 right[2], bottom row 7 right[3]\\n\\nOutput row 2: [8,9,9,8] — let\\'s say bottom row 8 right[0] =8, top row 2 right[1] =9, top row 2 right[2] =9, bottom row 8 right[3] =8\\n\\nOutput row 3: [0,8,7,2]\\n\\n0: from where?

Let\\'s say top row 3 left[0] =0, bottom row 9 right[1] =8? bottom row 9: [0,0,0,2,4,0,8,0,0] so right: [0,8,0,0] so right[1]=8, top row 3 left[2] =7, and 2 from bottom row 6 left[2] or something.\\n\\nBottom row 6: [2,0,2,0,4,0,0,0,0] left: [2,0,2,0] so left[2]=2\\n\\nSo output row 3: [top row 3 left[0], bottom row 9 right[1], top row 3 left[2], bottom row 6 left[2]] = [0,8,7,2] — yes.\\n\\nOutput row 4: [7,0,8,8] = top row 4 left[0] =7, top row 4 left[1] =0? top row 4 left: [7,0,7,7] so left[1]=0, but output has 0 as second element, then 8,8.\\n\\n8 from bottom row 10 right[2]

      "\n",
      "We have a group of people who are in **two circles**:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Alice's circle**: Alice has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.  \n",
      "  So, in Alice's circle:  \n",
      "  - 3 males  \n",
      "  - 5 females  \n",
      "  - Alice herself is not counted in the \"colleagues\" — so the circle includes her 3 male and 5 female colleagues.\n",

      "Also, **all mentioned persons have no colleagues beyond the described group** — meaning no one outside these two circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the entire group is the union of:\n",
      "- Alice’s circle (3 males, 5 females, plus Alice)\n",

      "- The 1 male in Bob’s circle is colleague only with the others in Bob’s circle — so only with Matilda and the other female in Bob’s circle.\n",
      "- The other female in Bob’s circle is colleague only with Bob and Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, **Matilda’s colleagues** are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. All people in Alice’s circle **except herself** → 3 males + 4 other females (since 5 females total in Alice’s circle, minus Matilda)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. All people in Bob’s circle **except herself** → 1 male + 1 other female (since 2 females in Bob’s circle, minus Matilda)\n",

      "- 1 female (from Bob’s circle)\n",
      "\n",
      "So total colleagues: 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9 colleagues\n",

      "- From Alice’s circle: 4 female colleagues (excluding Matilda)\n",
      "- From Bob’s circle: 1 female colleague (the other female in Bob’s circle)\n",
      "\n",
      "So total female colleagues of Matilda: 4 + 1 = **5**\n",

      "But wait — is the female in Bob’s circle a colleague of Alice?\n",
      "\n",
      "No — because the only overlap is Matilda.\n",

      "\n",
      "In Bob’s circle: 2 females and 1 male → yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Bob has:\n",

      "- 1 male colleague: the male in Bob’s circle\n",
      "\n",
      "So Bob’s colleagues: 3 people → 2 females, 1 male → matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the people in Bob’s circle have no colleagues outside — except Matilda.\n",

      "So the male in Bob’s circle has colleagues: Bob and Matilda → only two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other female in Bob’s circle has colleagues: Bob and Matilda → only two.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice has 5 female colleagues — all 5 in her circle.\n",

      "So the 5 females in Alice’s circle are:\n",
